# Contributing Development Guides

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask or submit the
issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best
effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change
something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of
rules to get in the way of that.

That said, if you want to ensure that a pull request is likely to be merged, talk to us!

## Getting Started

### Some Ways to Contribute

* Report mistakes.
* Suggest enhancements.
* Submit enhancements (new chemistry guides, push/pull guides, other).
* Improve our guides and documentation.

### Reporting an Issue

>Note: Issues on GitHub for this repository are intended to be related to bugs or feature requests.

* Check existing issues (both open and closed) to make sure it has not been
reported previously.

* Aim to respond promptly to any questions made by the team on your
issue. Stale issues will be closed.

## Making Changes to Guides

### Prerequisites

If you wish to work on Consul itself, you'll first need to:

- [fork the repo](../docs/contributing/fork-the-project.md)

### Modifying the Code

#### Code Formatting

Simply,

- spaces between paragraphs
- either single line paragraphs, or 80 character columns
- new line at end of file
- four space character indents instead of tabs
- be consistent, mimic what already exists

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before writing any code, we recommend:

- Create a Github issue if none already exists for the code change you'd like to make.
- Write a comment on the Github issue indicating you're interested in contributing so maintainers can provide their perspective if needed.

Keep your pull requests (PRs) small and open them early so you can get feedback on
approach from maintainers before investing your time in larger changes.

When you're ready to submit a pull request:
1. Review the [list of checklists](#checklists) for common changes and follow any
   that apply to your work.
2. Open the PR from your fork against base repository `rbuck/film.photographie` and branch `main`.
3. After you address Guides maintainer feedback and the PR is approved, a maintainer
   will merge it. Your contribution will be available immediately.
