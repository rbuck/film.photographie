# Color Processing

Standard Processing Steps For Rotation or Inversion Methods For processing with a Paterson® or JOBO® type plastic tank or Nikor® stainless tank with rotation or inversion agitation, or open tank with lift rod agitation.

Rotation tanks and chemicals should be tempered in a water bath
with the TCS-1000 to maintain solution temperatures. ‡Add 2ºF to the developer before using inversions without a bath.
